# JSON 101

The BIDS statistical models are written in JSON files.

If you have never heard of JSON, this section is for you.

Here we will quickly:

- explain some of the terms that you need to be familiar to work with JSON
- suggest some tools that you may want to use to make it easier for you to work
  with JSON.

## JSON terms

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and as its name indicates takes its
syntax from the JavaScript language.

The main "building blocks" of JSON you must be familiar with are `Objects` and
`Arrays`.

### Objects

In JSON, objects

- are opened and closes by curly brackets `{ }`
- are a collection of keyâ€“value pairs where:
  - the keys are strings
  - the key and the value are separated by a colum `:`

For example, this is an object.

```json
{ "Key": "value", "Key2": 1 }
```

As you can see, in JSON strings start and end with double quotes `"`. Also note
the comma between the key-value pairs but not after the last key-value pair.

### Arrays

In JSON, arrays are:

- are opened and closes by square brackets `[ ]`
- an ordered list of zero or more elements, each of which may be of any type
  (string, number..)
- elements must be separated by a comma

```json
["this", "is", 1, "JSON", "array"]
```

### A note on Booleans

In JSON boolean values must be typed as lowercase with no quotes:

- `true`
- `false`

### JSON "styling"

In JavaScript it is custom to use CamelCase to write code, this is why most of
keys you will see in JSON are also in CamelCase.

<!-- Add link to camelcase wikipedia -->

For example:

```json
{ "ThisIsTrue": true, "ThisIsTrue": false }
```

It is common to indent JSON files to help human readibility.

```json
{
  "ThisIsTrue": true,
  "ThisIsTrue": false
}
```

Finally, you cannot add comments in JSON files, but the BIDS stats model allows
you to add a `"Description"` key to most objects to give explanations to the
reader.

### Nesting

JSON allows to "nest" objects within objects, to create arrays of objects and
combine all those elements however deep you want or need.

Just remember to place commas:

- between array elements
- between key-value pairs
- unless this is the last element (or key-value pair)

```json
{
  "MixedArray": ["This", "is", "one", "array"],
  "ArrayOfNumbers": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  "ArrayOfObjects": [
    {
      "NestedObject": true,
      "Content": { "value": 0 }
    },
    {
      "NestedObject": false,
      "Content": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### JSON schema

If the content of your JSON must follow certain rules, like

> your JSON file must contain a key-value pair
>
> - with a key called: "Version"
> - with a value that must be a number

Then you can specify those rules in what is called a JSON schema.

## Working with JSON

### In the browser

Working with JSON can be a headache if you do not have the proper tools.

To get started we suggest playing around with JSON in an online editor, to get a
feeling for how JSON works.

See for example this one: http://jsoneditoronline.org/

Online editors can also usually tell you if you forgot a comma, forgot to close
a bracket or something similar. And even fix mistakes for you.

If you directly want to edit you BIDS stats model JSON in the browser, you can
also use the BIDS stats model JSON schema by clicking
`Options --> JSON schema --> URL` and give it this URL:

https://bids-standard.github.io/stats-models/BIDSStatsModel.json

### On your computer

If you need to edit JSON files on your computer, it will make your life easier
if you use a modern code editor like:

- [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [atom](https://atom.io/)

Modern code editors can tell you if you have a valid JSON file and highlight the
lines where you have errors. Most of them usually also have code formatting
extensions that can automatically indent your JSON like
[Prettier for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

You can also validate the BIDS stats model as you are creating it:

- by adding the following key-value pair in your BIDS stats model,

```json
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bids-standard/stats-models/gh-pages/BIDSStatsModel.json",
```

For vs-code you can also add this to your settings:

```json
"json.schemas": [
    {"fileMatch": [
            "model-*_smdl.json"
        ],
        "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bids-standard/stats-models/gh-pages/BIDSStatsModel.json"
    }
]
```
