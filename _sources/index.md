BIDS Stats Models
=================

*A specification for neuroimaging statistical models.*

*BIDS Stats Models* (BSM) describe how to fit *statistical models for neuroimaging data* using *a machine-readable JSON document*.  Its purpose is prescriptive (e.g. a recipe), rather than descriptive (e.g. summary of already fit models). 

A *BSM*â€”in combination with a preprocessed BIDS datasetâ€”is sufficient to execute statistical models, with minimal configuration and intervention required from the user.

The **mission** of *BSM* is to promote scientific best practice by making neuroimaging models *transparent and reproducible*, as well as encourging the development of *standardized and automated* statistical analysis pipelines.
